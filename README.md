# Exploratory Data Analysis of Gamified User Types (Hexad-12)

## Project Description
This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines Hexad-12 user motivation profiles using international survey data. It identifies predominant user types, explores their demographics, and reveals correlations to inform gamified system design for tailored user engagement.

## Objectives
- Identify predominant Hexad-12 user types in the sample.
- Explore relationships between motivational profiles and demographic variables.
- Discover correlations and insights for designing engaging gamified systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- pandasql for SQL querying of DataFrames
- Google Colab environment for notebook execution

## Key Findings
- The Philanthropist profile was the most common, followed by Achiever and Player.
- The sample mainly consisted of young adults, with a notable proportion from the UK.
- Significant correlations found between Philanthropist & Socializer and Disruptor & Free Spirit types.
- Results suggest targeting gamification around dominant profiles to boost engagement.
